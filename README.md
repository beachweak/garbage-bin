# garbage-bin
a bunch of junk; mostly from music video projects i've worked on that need 3D visuals

# notes

- mostly everything here is used in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wye4Nyw4Qk) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktj6yd--zLE)
- particles.py is broken upon launch as it requires you set an image for it to generate particles
- the russian in russian-text.py says Псевдо-растяжение звука во времени (Pseudo stretching of sound in time) and you can change this if you want
- i never used statistics-unused.py in any of the videos (as the name suggests) as it was a test of what i could do w/ coded visuals
- feel free to use these if you want! credit me! or don't!
